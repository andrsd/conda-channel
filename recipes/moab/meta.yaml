about:
  summary: |
    The Mesh-Oriented datABase MOAB is a component for representing and evaluating mesh data. MOAB can store structured
    and unstructured mesh, consisting of elements in the finite element “zoo” plus polygons and polyhedra. The
    functional interface to MOAB is simple yet powerful, allowing the representation of many types of metadata commonly
    found on the mesh. MOAB is optimized for efficiency in space and time, based on access to mesh in chunks rather
    than through individual entities, while also versatile enough to support individual entity access.
